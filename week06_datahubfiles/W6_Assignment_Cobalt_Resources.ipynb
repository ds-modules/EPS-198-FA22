    "To electrify more of the electric grid and transportation, more metals are being mined. Batteries are driving a particular demand for cobalt as lithium-ion batteries utilize a chemical reaction between lithium and cobalt oxide. There are major problems with the current cobolt supply particularly with there being small-scale mines that are unregulated with regard to safety, child labor and environmental impact. \n",

    "## Your task in this assignment is to track down what types of igneous rocks have the most cobalt (Co) by completing the following assessments:\n",

    "1) Compare the distributions of cobalt in the COMPOSITION categories of 'FELSIC', 'INTERMEDIATE', 'MAFIC', 'ULTRAMAFIC' using both probability density estimates and box-plots. For the box plot, I recommend using `sns.boxenplot` and setting the ylim so it is zoomed in on the boxes. **Answer this question, if you were going to target one of these compositions for mineral exploration, which one would you target?**\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The lowest grade of ore that is mined for cobalt is 0.01%. **How many data points have concentrations of cobalt that might be this high (recall that the data are in ppm)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Let's say you **needed** to make a choice whether to explore in mafic intrusive (plutonic) rocks or mafic volcanics rocks. The coarser-grained plutonic rocks that crystallized underground have the 'PLUTONIC' label in the 'TYPE' column while the volcanic rocks have the 'VOLCANIC' label. **Use the A/B test framework and determine whether both the mean and the median are statistically distinct from that which would result from random permutations. Would you explore plutonic or volcanic mafic rocks?**"
