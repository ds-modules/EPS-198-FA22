    "The frequency of earthquake recurrence as a function of magnitude has been a focus of seismological research since Gutenberg and Richter's pioneering work (Gutenberg and Richter, 1949). The evidence shows that the numbers of earthquakes in a given time period scales logarthmically with magnitude. To first order there are 10 times more magnitude 5 earthquakes compared to magnitude 6 events, and 10 times more magnitude 4 earthquakes compared to magnitude 5 quakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gutenberg and Richter found that when the base-10 logarithm of the number of earthquakes is plotted vs. magnitude that the distribution may be plotted as the line, log10(N)=A+Bm, where N is the number of earthquakes, m is the magnitude and A and B are the slope and intercept of a line. For the example described above the B-value is equal to -1 (there are 10 times fewer earthquakes for an increase of one magnitude unit). An important point to keep in mind that these parameters are based on a primary earthquake catalog in which aftershocks have been removed. **The process of aftershock removal is called declustering.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this important? The A- and B-values are often used to characterize the rates of earthquakes to use in earthquake forecasting and can be a distinguising characteristic of different classes of earthquakes. The B-value (slope parameter) is often used to distinquish between 'normal' and 'swarm-like' earthquake behavior. In geothermal areas it has been observed that the earthquake distribution is richer in small earthquakes indicating a B-value significantly less than -1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gutenberg Richter is also used to characterize seismic hazard in a region by defining the annual rate of earthquake occurrence. In this notebook you will analyze an earthquake catalog downloaded from the Northern California Earthquake Data Center from around the Berkeley Campus. You will learn how to decluster the seismicity catalog, estimate the Gutenberg Richter A- and B- values, and estimate the annual recurrence rates of large earthquake in the region."
